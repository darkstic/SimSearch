SimSearch Alpha Testing license agreement:
==========================================

Compliance with the rules, statutes and 
requirements outlined in this document is
absolutely necessary for eligibility for 
participation in the Alpha testing process
for the SimSearch web browser. Any violation,
non-compliant action, or otherwise miscreant
behaviors in association with the use and testing
of this product will result in an immediate 
disqualification for testing or use of the product.
Any actions on the part of the user, deemed illegal,
unlawful, or otherwise as a violation of legal
protections may result in legal action against the
perpetrator(s) on the part of me, the developer.

Or in other words, don't be a jerk. It's annoying
and it makes people dislike you. We don't want that.

1. Users must have been contacted and given written
approval from myself (the developer) to be eligible for
alpha testing SimSearch.

2. No serious attempts may be made to reverse engineer or
modify the functionality of the SimSearch.EXE file.

3. Absolutely no attempts to plagiarize, violate the copyright
of, or take credit for the SimSearch program, in whole or in
part will be tolerated.

4. Feedback for the project is highly encouraged and
necessary for the development and improvement of the program.
All feedback should be sent directly to me (the developer) through
private avenues of communication.

5. SimSearch does not currently employ any form of content
restrictions or website blocking. This means that the risk of
encountering dangerous content online though use of the program is
possible. Moral and ethical conduct is required during use of the
program, and any use of SimSearch for questionable, yucky, or otherwise
damaging use is prohibited and may lead to a permanent ban for use of
SimSearch in the future. (I know I'm being somewhat vague, but you know
what I'm talking about.)

6. I (the developer) cannot take any responsibility for the actions
and use of anyone using SimSearch. Any illegal online activity, 
including but not limited to: piracy, extorsion, visiting filelist.ro,
cyberbullying, posting obnoxious reddit comments, or viewing illegal
content is absolutely prohibited and is not condoned or permitted by
me (the developer).

Use of the SimSearch web browser indicates a legal agreement to
abide by the above terms. Happy testing!
